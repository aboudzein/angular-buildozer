# Angular buildozer
A Boilerplate build on top of latest Angular version, It's ready for production, yet not totally configured.

I'm using it in my personal and work projects, whilst it's a good resource to learn from

### Better docs will be available soon, with inclusive demonstrations about the folder structure and the constraint that it was built upon

## help is welcomed

### Don't heistate to try it

After cloning the project run `npm install && ng serve -o`
